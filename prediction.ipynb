    "# Stock Price Prediction with Optimized LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook implements an advanced stock price prediction model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, optimized with `keras-tuner` for hyperparameter tuning. It predicts the closing price of Tesla (TSLA) stock using historical data from 2020 to March 31, 2025, stored in a static SQLite database. The model leverages technical indicators and demonstrates skills in machine learning, data analysis, and software engineering, making it a strong portfolio piece for AI Engineer and Data Analyst roles in Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "### New Features Compared to the Previous Version\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a concise and precise list of new features and enhancements in this version compared to the previous version of this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **New Features**:\n",
    "  - Added lagged prices (`Lag_1`, `Lag_2`, `Lag_3`) to capture short-term dependencies.\n",
    "  - Replaced random `Sentiment` with a rule-based approach (based on price change).\n",
    "- **Model Architecture**:\n",
    "  - Simplified to a two-layer LSTM (64, 32 units) without Bidirectional layers to reduce underfitting.\n",
    "  - Reduced dropout rate from 0.3 to 0.2 to allow better learning.\n",
    "- **Training Enhancements**:\n",
    "  - Reduced `sequence_length` from 30 to 15 to focus on short-term trends.\n",
    "  - Lowered batch size from 128 to 64 for better convergence.\n",
    "  - Adjusted learning rate to 0.0005 for more stable training.\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling**:\n",
    "  - Switched from `MinMaxScaler` to `RobustScaler` to handle outliers better.\n",
    "- **Model Compatibility**:\n",
    "  - Added feature count validation to retrain the model if the number of features changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is This Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**: The model features a two-layer LSTM with 64 units in the first layer and 32 in the second, followed by dense layers. Hyperparameter optimization with `keras-tuner` tunes units, learning rate, and dropout, ensuring adaptability.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately $12.80 (based on initial runs), with a predicted next-day price of $272.49 (as of June 21, 2025). Optimization aims to reduce this further.\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Captures short-term trends with lagged prices and benefits from optimized hyperparameters. Technical indicators enhance feature richness.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Lags on sharp price changes and relies on static data up to March 31, 2025. The rule-based sentiment is a placeholder—real data could improve accuracy.\n",
    "- **Impression**: This model showcases advanced AI techniques (optimization, feature engineering), ideal for financial forecasting and impressing HR in Australia’s AI sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.7–3.11\n",
    "- Required libraries: `pip install pandas yfinance numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib ta keras-tuner`\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run This Notebook\n",
    "1. Install dependencies in the next cell.\n",
    "2. Run all cells sequentially. The first run performs hyperparameter tuning (5-10 minutes), creating `stock_data_static.db` and `tuner_dir`.\n",
    "3. Subsequent runs use the best model (1-2 minutes).\n",
    "4. Check the output plot and summary in the final cells. If an error occurs, note the traceback and share it for debugging.\n"
